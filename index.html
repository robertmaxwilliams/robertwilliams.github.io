            <p>I have many projects and goals. I want to develop the technologies that will enable general AI
            and human conciousness within machines this century. You'll find this website full of work I've done
            and links to things I think are interesting or important.</p> 
            <p> I'll have a nice grid of links with thumbnails eventually, for now there's just this list:</p>
        <p> <a href = "forts_and_ruins.html">Forts and Ruins</a>
